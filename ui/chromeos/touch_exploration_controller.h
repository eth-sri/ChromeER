// TouchExplorationController is used in tandem with "Spoken Feedback" to
// make the touch UI accessible. Gestures are mapped to accessiblity key
// shortcuts.
//
// ** Short version **
//
// At a high-level, single-finger events are used for accessibility -
// exploring the screen gets turned into mouse moves (which can then be
// spoken by an accessibility service running), a single tap while the user
// is in touch exploration or a double-tap simulates a click, and gestures
// can be used to send high-level accessibility commands. For example, a swipe
// right would correspond to the keyboard short cut shift+search+right.
// When two or more fingers are pressed initially, from then on the events
// are passed through, but with the initial finger removed - so if you swipe
// down with two fingers, the running app will see a one-finger swipe.
//
// ** Long version **
//
// Here are the details of the implementation:
//
// When the first touch is pressed, a 300 ms grace period timer starts.
//
// If the user keeps their finger down for more than 300 ms and doesn't
// perform a supported accessibility gesture in that time (e.g. swipe right),
// they enter touch exploration mode, and all movements are translated into
// synthesized mouse move events.
//
// Also, if the user moves their single finger outside a certain slop region
// (without performing a gesture), they enter touch exploration mode earlier
// than 300 ms.
//
// If the user taps and releases their finger, after 300 ms from the initial
// touch, a single mouse move is fired.
//
// While in touch exploration mode, the user can perform a single tap
// if the user releases their finger and taps before 300 ms passes.
// This will result in a click on the last successful touch exploration
// location. This allows the user to perform a single tap
// anywhere to activate it.
//
// The user can perform swipe gestures in one of the four cardinal directions
// which will be interpreted and used to control the UI. The gesture will only
// be registered if the finger moves outside the slop and completed within the
// grace period. If additional fingers are added during the grace period, the
// state changes to passthrough. If the gesture fails to be completed within the
// grace period, the state changes to touch exploration mode. Once the state has
// changed, any gestures made during the grace period are discarded.
//
// If the user double-taps, the second tap is passed through, allowing the
// user to click - however, the double-tap location is changed to the location
// of the last successful touch exploration - that allows the user to explore
// anywhere on the screen, hear its description, then double-tap anywhere
// to activate it.
//
// If the user enters touch exploration mode, they can click without lifting
// their touch exploration finger by tapping anywhere else on the screen with
// a second finger, while the touch exploration finger is still pressed.
//
// If the user adds a second finger during the grace period, they enter
// two to one finger passthrough mode. In this mode, the first finger is
// ignored and the user can scroll or drag with the second finger. If either
// finger is released, nothing happens until all fingers are up. If the user
// adds a third finger while in two to one finger mode, all fingers and touch
// events are passed through from then on.
//
// Once touch exploration mode has been activated,
// it remains in that mode until all fingers have been released.
//
// The caller is expected to retain ownership of instances of this class and
// destroy them before |root_window| is destroyed.
